# Image Super Resolution and denoising
## → Part 1 : Generic Super Resolution :
A single Image super-resolution model aims to significantly increase the purity and resolution of low quality images without losing information or, in other cases, adding (too much) false information. In most digital imaging applications, high-resolution images are usually desired for later image processing and analysis

## → Part 2 : Additional processing via image denoising :
An image denoising model is used to further remove noise from the outcome of the generic super resolution model , giving an altogether more polished look and better purity to the output image .
